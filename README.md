# Time-series-analysis-with-neural-nets

This project aims to predict the price of a stock in the next day based on history values. The main focuses are tuning the number of past days to look back when predicting the next day's value and implementing a simple Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM). ARIMA model has been proved to derive reliable insights from time series data. Support Vector Machine - Regression is also capable to deal with high-dimensional data which is suitable for this case.
